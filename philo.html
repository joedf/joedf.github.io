# Philosophical Ideas
**_by Joachim de Fourestier_**

--------------------------------

###Random Quote #1
"Tout est absolument relatif." / "Everything is absolutely relative."

###Random Quote #2
"The absolute is just relativity wearing its tuxedo."

###The Sign of Ignorance
It is in my belief that one must be open-minded in order to think [*clearly*], to be authentic and to be able to progress [*in all*]. Nothing is *simply* "correct", nor is anything *simply* "wrong". On the expression of one's perception/belief (on a subject), the *automatic* reaction of rejection or denial without consent of the **full** expression is a sign of *ignorance*. In other words, I am open to all opinions. I welcome you to express yourself **fully** when necessary.

###Random Quote #3
"Une idée authentique, peu importe si elle est vraie ou fausse, implique une _certaine_ (quantité) véritée."

###L'imposition des valeurs d'autrui
**[WIP]**

###Random Quote #4
"If an _insult_ [or something] is false, then one may express anger because it was probably meant to harm one. But, when an insult is true, then anger should not be expressed, for it may have been used as a reminder to one."

###Random Quote #5
I used to think that one should never be angry. With time, I realized that is not the case. I do believe that one should avoid anger, but there is a time for anger. One may be angry if it is in the purpose to get attention when all else fails. The matter is in reality that one should not "give in" to anger, to simply let it fall on others.

###Random Quote #6
"Life is like a tree, you don't define it."

###Random Quote #7
"So, you want to do it the _moral_ way or the _logical_ way?"

###Reason is biased
Is rationality right? Is reason itself the "correct" path? It seems to be an assumption that one makes almost inevitably. "Rationalizing" this idea is in itself a biased way at attempting to resolve this problem, because we then fall into the trap of our own default assumption that reason is _the_ correct path. What if reason is not something we should follow, to rely on? But then... "It makes no sense!" ... Correct. That's the point. This question may seem childish, but is truly quite interesting since it tackles directly our minds' only(?) means of _intellectual_ defense.

###Why do we live?
Is life's priority health, happiness, kindness? What is joy? I used to think that it was simply for happiness as Descartes might have thought. If we are unhealthy, it does not make us happy but most likely makes us unhappy. That is why we tend to avoid sickness. Kindness can make us happy, but there seems to be something more. It is after studying Pascal, that I realized the _more_ precise answer to this question. We live for _pleasure_. In the sense, that we do as we please, and we avoid what displeases us. Does eating make you happy? Not necessarily, rather it pleases you not to be hungry. It is in the sense to avoid displeasure **and** to seek what pleases us.

###Random Quote #8
"Do not waste the essence of thought, unless one wants writer's block."

###The "How it starts" phenomenon
At first, it is unthought of. Then, it  is treated as privilege. Then as habit, then it becomes a "naturality" of a routine. And lastly, it morphs into a requirement, desired as right.

###Random Quote #9
"-What is it?  
-[incentive of fool/stupidity]  
-**Knowledge** does not define intelligence.  
-Knowledge is power.  
-Ahh, but Knowledge is nothing without the intelligence to comprehend it."

###Stress
It is inevitable. It affects us greatly. Yet, we choose wether to react to it or not.

###L'argent et le Bonheur
[Citation] « [...] [L'argent] représente notre confiance. Il faut retenir que le bonheur ne *provient* [(origine: La question c'est "Est-ce que le bonheur peu exister sans l'argent?")] pas de l'argent, alors l'argent ne fait pas le bonheur. Le bonheur *provient* du soi, de nos émotions. En somme, l'argent ne peut pas "faire" le bonheur, mais plutôt elle peut influencer nos émotions, nos idées. [...] En sachant cela, il est complètement inutile de dire que l'argent peut nous conduire au bonheur parce que pratiquement tout influence nos émotions (à l'exception des psychopathes). »

###Abuse [excess] of Rights
Absurd. If one can abuse their own rights, then they are known as privileges, not rights. That is the clear difference between the two.

###Random Quote #10
**[Non-New]** One must take pride in what [or everything] they do in order to achieve [near absolute] success.

###Majority is impulsively better
"-Well, the **majority** is right!  
-Is the majority smart?  
-No..."  
Here, we see that the second made the first insult oneself, because of negligence and impulsivity.

###Random Quote #11
I've come to realize that **fear** is not useless nor unimportant. It is not "stupid". What is actually "stupid", is how we choose to react to it just like what we have with stress.

###Modern Democracy is a utilitarian mesure
The term democracy devrives from the term _dêmos_[<sup>1</sup>][1] and _kratía_[<sup>2</sup>][2] from Ancient Greek signifying 'the people' and 'rule'. More modernly, the prefix "demo-", here, is used to specify the 'majority of people'[<sup>3</sup>][3]. In such a policy as _Democracy_, we aknowledge the fact of an absolute approval from all decision-making individuals is a (near impossible and ideal) utopian case. In contrast, a republic (a true one, in the sense from Ancient Rome) allows the right of _veto_. Its purpose is to restrict or moderate the power of high officials, allowing it's holder to protect the _status quo_. Explicitely, it means that absolutely all decision-making members must reach a consensus or mutual agreement. Otherwise, the status quo remains. Utilitarianism is an ethic, where its ways can be justified by its means: "the consequences of any action are the only standard of right and wrong"[<sup>4</sup>][4]. This is infact its strong point, because it can always achieve an answer, even in very diffcult situations. Unfortunately, this means **highly immoral** actions (_ways_) can be let by, and are as such, justified (by its means). This ethic also aims the greater quantity and quality. Thus, it can justify ignoring the cause of everything else. This is infact the clause of "**The greater good**", or in some cases "The lesser evil". Where as in Kantian ethics, it is more of an _aut omnia aut nihil_ ("all or nothing") ethic, meaning that only one _wrong_ action or consequence considers the whole action to be immoral. This philosophy declines all that is (a "little or extremely") immoral: thus it is sometimes considered to be too unforgiving. 
  
As languages evolve, so do perceptions. "Democracy" now has a positive connotation, while as "Dictatorship" has a negative connotation. That said, dictatorship in itself in not necessarily bad or wrong, but it is very often (or even automatically) assumed to be something negative. eg. Caesar was hardly the greatest man who ever ruled, but his dictatorship proved to be a promising effort in improving the life and way of its people. 
   
(Ancient Greek) Democracy aims to represent the "most opinions from all people", but what Modern Democracy infact does is representing only the opinion of the majority (of people). In other words, it is possible for a minority to rule over the entirety of the population. For example: Group A is 40% of the population, Group B is 35% and Group C is 25%. Logically, Group A wins the vote. However, the sum of Group B and Group C is 60% of the population. Thus, the minority Group A, representing only 40% of the population, has all authority over the entire population. To clarify, this is a form of "Mob Rule" or more formalily, Ochlocracy[<sup>5</sup>][5]: where a smaller crowd rules over the entire society. The main cause of this injustice, is an inappropriate voting system. 
  
A true democracy has the entire people involved in the decsion-making process (on **every** single decision). In other words, everyone has their "say" on everything. On the other hand, the modern version of it has its people voting for a much smaller group of individuals to then, decide what is best for all (sometimes or mostly, for themselves). Thus, not everyone has their "say". Of course, this newer voting system was put into place precisely because democracy is unfit for excessively large societies (compared to ancient times). 
  
A possible or better solution is Single-Transferable Vote (STV), since it completely abolishes the need of "startegic voting". ("strategic voting" being _somewhat_ undemocratic.)
