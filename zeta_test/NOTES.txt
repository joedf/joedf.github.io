Using ~build.strapdown-zeta_v0.74-cdnjs_mathjax2.7.2.min

- CSS needs some fixing?
- test overflow long menu, need to be scrollable, use css, check mobile

.navbar-nav > li > .dropdown-menu {
	max-height: 436px;
	overflow-y: auto;
}


- header achors, hide zeta's or mine for paragraph symbol
- logo js, needs update
- simplyfiy dayandnight.js to use the set_theme(), get theme with; var theme = strapdown_store.get('theme');
	day: Yeti, night: darkly.

- zeta seems to have some junk and is no the most light weight. consider maybe alternative?
