I am a programmer who :
  
 - loves the [C programming language][2] and the [AutoHotkey scripting language][8]
 - favours the [MIT License][3]
 - has a minimalistic website, because I like to be straight forward
 - knows many programming languages due to quick logical adaptation
 - is an avid Web Developper
 - is a [Socialist][4], not [Communist][5]
 - is a Manager / Webmaster at the [AutoHotkey Foundation LLC][9]
  
I have a passion for philosophy and design. I discuss matters about ethics, theology and metaphysics. I am an agnostic in the following sense :
> Agnosticism - the belief that the existence or non-existence of deities or God is currently unknown or unknowable and cannot be proven. A weaker form of this might be defined as simply a lack of certainty about gods' existence or nonexistence.

> Source : [Wikipedia/Philosophy_of_religion][6]
  
**"Philosophical Ideas"** : Some of my ideas and notes, some in French, some in English. [[View]](./philo.html)
  
I am actually a *Huguenot* (by decent). I am in my young adult years. My mother is from Shanghai. My father is from Montreal with both German parents. I am therefore half Chinese, half German. I was born in Ottawa, the capital of Canada in 1995.
  
I speak five languages :

 - French
 - English
 - German
 - Mandarin
 - Spanish (learning, personal interest)

My first instrument was supposed to be the violin. My teacher made me promise never to give up no matter how difficult things would be. I promised. I did learn some basics, but my teacher was the one ending up not holding his end of our agreement. I ended up learning piano. It was enjoyable. My sister was significantly more advanced than me. **[Many years later, parents divorced, etc]** I started to learn guitar. I have been *playing* ever since. It will soon be seven years since I first started.
  
It is in my belief that one must be open-minded in order to think [*clearly*], to be authentic and to be able to progress [*in all*]. Nothing is *simply* "correct", nor is anything *simply* "wrong". On the expression of one's perception/belief on a subject, the *automatic* reaction of rejection or denial without consent of the **full** expression is a sign of *ignorance*. In other words, I am open to all opinions. I welcome you to express yourself **fully** when necessary.
