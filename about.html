Joe DF
------------

I am a programmer who :

 - loves the [C programming language][2] and the [AutoHotkey scripting language][8].
 - favours the [MIT License][3].
 - has a minimalistic website, because I like to be straight forward and lazy.
 - knows many programming languages such as C/C++, C#, Python, PHP, Javascript, AHK, Lua, Rust, etc.
 - is an avid Web Developer.
 - identifies loosely as a [Social Democrat][4], not [Democratic Socialist][29] or [Communist][5].
 - is a Manager at the [AutoHotkey Foundation LLC][9].
 - has a [LinkedIn][23] profile.
 - built his first custom gaming PC üñ•Ô∏èüéÆ on June 30th, 2018.
 - likes all kinds of music, but mostly listens to things like Lemaitre üåå, Kavinsky üéß, Daft Punk ü§ñ, or deadmau5 üêÅ.
 - graduated in 2019 with a B.Sc. (Hons.) in [Earth Sciences][12] at [Carleton University][13].
 - is currently an [Industrial PhD][30] candidate in [Materials Science and Engineering][31] at [McMaster University][32], particularly on Correlative Microscopy.  

I have a passion for philosophy and design. I discuss matters about ethics, theology, epistemology and metaphysics. I am an agnostic in the following sense :
> Agnosticism - the belief that the existence or non-existence of deities or God is currently unknown or unknowable and cannot be proven. A weaker form of this might be defined as simply a lack of certainty about gods' existence or nonexistence.

### Some history...
I am actually a [*Huguenot*][17] (by decent). My mother is from Shanghai. My father is from Montreal with both German parents. I am therefore half Chinese, half German. I was born in Ottawa, Canada in 1995.

I speak ~five languages :

 - French
 - English
 - German
 - Mandarin
 - Spanish (learning, personal interest)
 - Russian (still learning...)

My first instrument was supposed to be the violin. My teacher made me promise never to give up no matter how difficult things would be. I promised. I did learn some basics, but my teacher was the one ending up not holding his end of our agreement. I ended up learning piano. It was enjoyable. My sister was significantly more advanced than me. **[Many years later, parents divorced, etc]** I started to learn guitar. I have been *playing* ever since. I first started back in 2009.

It is in my belief that one must be open-minded in order to think [*clearly*], to be authentic and to be able to progress [*in all*]. Nothing is *simply* "correct", nor is anything *simply* "wrong". On the expression of one's perception/belief on a subject, the *automatic* reaction of rejection or denial without consent of the **full** expression is a sign of *ignorance*. In other words, I am open to all opinions. I welcome you to express yourself **fully** when necessary.

Don't be shy to [contact me][7]. Additionally, you may view my [LinkedIn profile][10] and [GitHub profile][11].
